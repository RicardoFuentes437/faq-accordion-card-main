## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how accordions work and how i can implement them, i've never worked with them before so it was very interesting to use them in this challenge.

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning about positioning, because i had a little bit of trouble positioning the box and making it stay in that position even when i resized the page, i would also like to continue working with accordions to learn more about them.

### Useful resources

- [Accordion](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) - This page helped me understand how accordions work and how i can create one.
- [Positioning](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15221579/resize-img-using-absolute-positioning) - This helped me understand how i could make the box stay at the same place even when resizing the page.
